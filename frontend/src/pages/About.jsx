        <h2>About AI Finance Assistant</h2>
        <p>
          Born from late nights parsing financial reports and building tools, AI Finance Assistant is the product of frustration
          turned innovation. Founded by <strong>Peter Ong</strong>, a software engineer obsessed with productivity and finance,
          this project aims to bridge humans and AI through intelligent document understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our assistant reads like an analyst, reasons like a human, and responds like a pro. Upload a report. Ask anything.
          It delivers answers in seconds â€” from earnings breakdowns to investment insights.
        </p>
